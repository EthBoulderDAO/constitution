Active contributors demonstrating alignment through sustained participation in the public network — the visible life of the nation where coordination, circles, and knowledge commoning happens in the open.

## Purpose

Participants have demonstrated that they can show up consistently, contribute constructively, and uphold the principles in practice. They are building the relationships and context that make governance meaningful.

## Criteria

- [[Newcomer]] who has completed introduction
- Sustained aligned participation over minimum 2 weeks
- Contribution to at least one [[Working Circle]]
- Agent-verified contribution patterns demonstrating alignment

## Participation Pathways

Alignment can be demonstrated through multiple pathways:

**Circle Contribution:** Active participation in Event, Knowledge, Third Space, or Grants circles

**Knowledge Graph Contribution:** Creating or enriching entities in the knowledge graph

**Event Participation:** Contributing to annual convening (session proposals, volunteering, hackathon)

**Third Space Cultivation:** Active presence in Boulder's third spaces, introducing the network to others

## Responsibilities

**Contribution:** Active participation in at least one circle

**Alignment:** Uphold principles in practice — in how you engage, handle disagreement, and show up for others

**Knowledge Commoning:** Contribute to the knowledge graph and shared documentation

**Governance Participation:** Raise objections in consent processes (not yet counted in quorum)

## Benefits

| Category | Access |
|----------|--------|
| **Channels** | All public channels (read/write), working circles |
| **Governance** | Raise objections, participate in discussions, not counted in quorum |
| **Treasury** | None |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Full read/write access to public entities, create new entities |

**Note:** Participants can raise objections but are not counted in governance quorum. This recognizes that consent without context is hollow — you need to know the network before you can meaningfully govern it.

## What Agents Look For

Pattern recognition across channels assesses:
- Does this person contribute to others' work or only promote their own?
- Do they engage with disagreement constructively?
- Do they uphold the principles when it costs them something?
- Do they show up consistently, not just when it's exciting?
- Do they contribute to the knowledge graph with accuracy and care?

## Membrane Crossing

To become a [[Member]]:
1. Demonstrate sustained alignment (minimum 2 weeks active participation)
2. Agent flags readiness based on contribution patterns
3. Any current [[Member]] nominates the Participant
4. Standard consent process: 3-member consent + 48h objection window
5. No unresolved paramount objections

## On-Chain Verification

| Discord | @Participant role | Bot upgrade on agent verification |
| Multi-sig | None | — |
| NFT | Participation NFT | Minted on membrane crossing |
