Active contributors demonstrating alignment through sustained participation in the public commons — the visible life of the nation where coordination, working circles, and knowledge commoning happens in the open.

## Purpose

Participants have demonstrated that they can show up consistently, contribute constructively, and uphold the principles in practice. They are building the relationships and context that make governance meaningful.

## Criteria

- [[Newcomer]] who has completed introduction
- Sustained aligned participation over minimum 2 weeks
- Contribution to at least one [[Working Circle]]
- Agent-verified contribution patterns demonstrating alignment

## Responsibilities

**Contribution:** Active participation in at least one working circle

**Alignment:** Uphold principles in practice — in how you engage, handle disagreement, and show up for others

**Knowledge Commoning:** Contribute to shared documentation and pattern development

**Governance Participation:** Raise objections in consent processes (not yet counted in quorum)

## Benefits

| Category | Access |
|----------|--------|
| **Channels** | All public channels (read/write), working circles |
| **Governance** | Raise objections, participate in discussions, not counted in quorum |
| **Treasury** | None |
| **Knowledge Commons** | Full read/write access to public documentation |

**Note:** Participants can raise objections but are not counted in governance quorum. This recognizes that consent without context is hollow — you need to know the commons before you can meaningfully govern it.

## What Agents Look For

Pattern recognition across channels assesses:
- Does this person contribute to others' work or only promote their own?
- Do they engage with disagreement constructively?
- Do they uphold the principles when it costs them something?
- Do they show up consistently, not just when it's exciting?

2. Agent flags readiness based on contribution patterns
3. Any current [[Member]] nominates the Participant
4. Standard consent process: 3-member consent + 48h objection window
5. No unresolved paramount objections
