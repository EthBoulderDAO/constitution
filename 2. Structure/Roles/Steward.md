Rotating curators with the highest trust level — those entrusted to tend conditions for the commons to self-govern while maintaining facilitation authority, moderation tools, and multisig signing power.

## Purpose

Stewards are curators, not gatekeepers. They tend conditions for the commons to self-govern. The moment stewardship becomes governance, it has failed. Monthly rotation ensures no one accumulates positional power.

## Criteria

- [[Member]] in good standing
- Deep commitment to commons purpose, values, and democratic accountability
- Demonstrated facilitation capacity
- Willingness to serve in rotating curator role
- Not seeking to accumulate positional power

## Responsibilities

**Facilitation:** Ensure consent processes are followed, call for escalation when consent is ambiguous

**Constitution:** Merge governance PRs after consent is documented

**Accountability:** Facilitate accountability processes when triggered per [[3. Protocols/Cultural Protocols/Accountability Protocol|Accountability Protocol]]

**Treasury:** Sign multisig transactions after proper approval

**Documentation:** Maintain `#stewardship` channel with transparent documentation

**Rotation:** Complete knowledge transfer during monthly handoff

## What Stewards Do NOT Have

- Tiebreaker power
- Veto authority
- Final say on content or direction
- Greater weight in consent processes

## Benefits

| Category | Access |
|----------|--------|
| **Authority** | Facilitation authority, moderation tools (serve commons, not person) |
| **Channels** | Full admin all channels including `#multisig-ops` |
| **Treasury** | Signer access — approve/reject proposed transactions |
| **Governance** | Same as Member — no additional voting weight |

**Note:** As a Steward, you are also a [[Member]] and retain all Member rights.
