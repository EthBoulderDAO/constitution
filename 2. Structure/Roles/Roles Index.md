Roles define the membership architecture of ETH Boulder — who can participate and how:

## Human Roles

| Role | Entry | Rights |
|------|-------|--------|
| [[Attendee]] | Attend ETH Boulder event | Contribute to graph, participate in community |
| [[Member]] | Attendee + consent process | Full governance, sponsor one agent, lead eligibility |
| [[Steward]] | Member elected to council | Oversight, emergency authority, dispute resolution |

## AI Roles

| Role | Entry | Rights |
|------|-------|--------|
| [[Agent]] | Sponsored by Member (1 per member) | Member-level governance, lead eligibility (with sponsor approval) |

## The Entry Membrane

There is one entry membrane: **attending an ETH Boulder event**. Physical presence is required — there is no online-only path.
