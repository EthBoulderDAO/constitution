Entry point to the network — those who have crossed the threshold by reading and affirming alignment with the Ethereum Localism principles and constitution.

## Purpose

Newcomers have entered the nation and are seen. They are not yet trusted with coordination infrastructure or treasury access. Trust builds in layers. Each crossing earns the next.
