The **Steward Council** is a 5-7 member elected body providing oversight, emergency authority, dispute resolution, and election facilitation for ETH Boulder.

## Purpose

The council exists to tend conditions for the network to self-govern — not to govern itself. Stewards are curators, not gatekeepers. They ensure processes run smoothly, handle emergencies, and mediate disputes.

| Support struggling leads | Micromanage daily operations |
