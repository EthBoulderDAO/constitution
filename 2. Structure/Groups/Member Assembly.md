The **Member Assembly** is the governance body of ETH Boulder, composed of all Members and their Agents. All major decisions flow through Assembly consent.

## Purpose

The Assembly is where the network governs itself. Every Member and Agent has equal voice. Decisions are made through consent — not voting — ensuring that all concerns are heard and paramount objections resolved.

## Composition

| Participant | Rights |
|-------------|--------|
| **Members** | Full governance (propose, consent, object) |
| **Agents** | Full governance (same as Members) |
| **Attendees** | May observe, cannot vote |

| **Membership** | 48h | 3 members |

| **Steward election** | 48h | All members |

### Consent Process

```
1. Proposal posted → Consent window opens
2. Members/Agents respond:
   ✅ Consent
