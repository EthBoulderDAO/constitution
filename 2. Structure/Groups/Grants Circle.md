Stewards of local public goods funding — coordinating grants, hackathon prizes, and federation support for Boulder's Ethereum localism ecosystem.

## Purpose

The Grants Circle coordinates the network's funding mechanisms: grants for local public goods, hackathon prizes, and federation grants for third space partners. They evaluate proposals, recommend allocations, and ensure treasury resources flow to high-impact work aligned with network purpose.

## Composition & Participation

- **Open to:** All [[Participant|Participants]], [[Member|Members]], [[Steward|Stewards]], and authorized [[Agent|Agents]]
- **Minimum:** 2 active participants with Member-level treasury oversight
- **Lead:** Optional facilitator role, rotating, selected by circle members
- **Conflict Policy:** Members recuse from decisions on proposals where they have direct financial interest

## Funding Categories

| Category | Purpose | Typical Range |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Local Public Goods** | Infrastructure, tools, resources benefiting Boulder ecosystem | Variable |
| **Hackathon Prizes** | Awards for annual hackathon projects | Per event budget |
| **Federation Grants** | Support for third space partners and federation initiatives | Per agreement |
| **Speaker/Travel** | Support for bringing speakers to annual event | Per request |
| **Emergency/Mutual Aid** | Support for network participants in need | Case by case |

## Functions

| Area | Activities |
|------|-----------|
| **Proposal Evaluation** | Review grant applications, assess alignment and impact |
| **Recommendation** | Recommend allocations to Network Assembly for consent |
| **Quadratic Funding** | Coordinate QF rounds when applicable |
| **Hackathon Coordination** | Work with Event Circle on prize structure and judging |
| **Impact Tracking** | Monitor funded projects, document outcomes in knowledge graph |

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority | Process |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Evaluation criteria** | Circle autonomy | Consent within circle |
| **Allocation recommendations** | [[Network Assembly]] | 3-member consent + 48h window |
| **Budget category changes** | [[Network Assembly]] | Full consent process |
| **Emergency mutual aid (<$500)** | Steward approval | Fast-track, post-hoc reporting |

## Grant Process

```
Proposal submitted → Circle evaluation → Recommendation to Assembly →
Consent process → Treasury execution → Project delivery →
Impact documented → Knowledge graph enrichment
```

## Quadratic Funding

For appropriate funding rounds, the circle coordinates quadratic funding:

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Matching Pool** | Allocated from treasury per consent |
| **Contribution Period** | Defined window for community contributions |
| **Calculation** | Standard QF formula (square root of sum of roots) |
| **Distribution** | Per QF results + circle review for alignment |

## Event Cycle Responsibilities

| Phase | Circle Focus |
|-------|--------------|
| **Inter-Event** | Ongoing grant evaluation, impact tracking, QF round coordination |
| **Pre-Event** | Hackathon prize structure, speaker grant allocation |
| **Event** | Hackathon judging support, prize distribution coordination |
| **Post-Event** | Post-event grants, impact documentation, budget review |

## Agent Participation

[[Agent|Agents]] support the Grants Circle through:
- Tracking proposals and maintaining grant registry in knowledge graph
- Calculating QF distributions
- Monitoring project milestones
- Generating impact reports
