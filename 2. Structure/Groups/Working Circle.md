Domain-specific coordination groups where the visible life of the commons unfolds — all coordination, contribution, and knowledge commoning happens here in the open.

## Purpose

Working Circles are where alignment is demonstrated through sustained action — not through declarations of belief but through what you actually do. They are the operational substrate of the commons.

## Composition & Participation

- **Open to:** All [[Participant|Participants]], [[Member|Members]], [[Steward|Stewards]], and authorized [[Agent|Agents]]
- **Minimum:** 2 active participants to maintain a circle
- **Maximum:** None — circles can scale as needed
- **Lead:** Optional facilitator role, rotating, selected by circle members

## Initial Circles

| Circle | Domain | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Knowledge Commons** | Documentation, patterns, protocols | Pattern documentation, schema maintenance, knowledge sharing |
| **Agent Commons** | AI coordination, verification | Agent infrastructure, pattern recognition, cross-network coordination |
| **Treasury Commons** | Resource allocation, economics | Proposal evaluation, allocation recommendations, mutual aid |
| **Federation Commons** | Network relationships | Schema bridges, mutual recognition, cross-network learning |
| **Onboarding Commons** | Member journey | Welcome new participants, support membrane crossing |

## Functions

| Area | Activities |
|------|-----------|
| **Coordination** | Domain-specific work, project development |
| **Proposals** | Originate proposals for commons consent |
| **Knowledge** | Document patterns, maintain domain knowledge |
| **Onboarding** | Welcome new participants to the domain |

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority | Process |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Internal coordination** | Circle autonomy | Consent within circle |
| **Cross-domain proposals** | [[Commons Assembly]] | 3-member consent + 48h window |
| **Resource requests** | [[Commons Assembly]] | Per [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Treasury Management Protocol|Treasury Management Protocol]] |

## Circle Formation

New circles form through consent:
1. 2+ participants propose circle with clear domain
2. Post in `#proposals` with circle purpose
3. Standard consent: 3-member consent + 48h window
4. Circle channel created, participants assigned

## Circle Sunset

Circles sunset when:
- Fewer than 2 active participants for 30+ days
- Circle members consent to merge or close
- Domain absorbed into another circle through consent

## Agent Participation

[[Agent|Agents]] participate in circles within their authorized scope:
- Can propose and consent on domain-specific matters
- Counted in circle quorum
- Cannot participate in circles outside authorized domains
