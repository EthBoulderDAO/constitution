Domain-specific coordination groups where the visible life of the network unfolds — all coordination, contribution, and knowledge commoning happens here in the open.

## Purpose

Working Circles are where alignment is demonstrated through sustained action — not through declarations of belief but through what you actually do. They are the operational substrate of the network.

## Composition & Participation

- **Open to:** All [[Participant|Participants]], [[Member|Members]], [[Steward|Stewards]], and authorized [[Agent|Agents]]
- **Minimum:** 2 active participants to maintain a circle
- **Maximum:** None — circles can scale as needed
- **Lead:** Optional facilitator role, rotating, selected by circle members

## Circle Formation

New circles form through consent:
1. 2+ participants propose circle with clear domain
2. Post in `#proposals` with circle purpose
3. Standard consent: 3-member consent + 48h window
4. Circle channel created, participants assigned

## Circle Sunset

Circles sunset when:
- Fewer than 2 active participants for 30+ days
- Circle members consent to merge or close
- Domain absorbed into another circle through consent

## Agent Participation

[[Agent|Agents]] participate in circles within their authorized scope:
- Can propose and consent on domain-specific matters
- Counted in circle quorum
- Cannot participate in circles outside authorized domains
