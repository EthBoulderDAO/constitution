The coordination body for ETH Boulder's annual convening — stewarding the constitutional moment when the network reconstitutes itself.

## Purpose

The Event Circle coordinates all aspects of the annual ETH Boulder convening: session scheduling, venue coordination, hackathon facilitation, and the integration of learnings into the knowledge graph. The event is not a conference — it is constitutional renewal.

## Composition & Participation

- **Open to:** All [[Participant|Participants]], [[Member|Members]], [[Steward|Stewards]], and authorized [[Agent|Agents]]
- **Steering Committee:** 3-5 Members, selected annually through consent
- **Lead:** Rotates among steering committee members by event cycle phase
- **Event Phase Lead:** Steward takes lead during Pre-Event and Event phases
