Stewards of the constitutional oracle — maintaining the knowledge graph that encodes the network's relationships, decisions, and collective intelligence.

## Purpose

The Knowledge Circle tends the knowledge graph as the network's collective memory and constitutional oracle. They ensure the graph accurately represents network state, resolve entity disputes, maintain schema integrity, and coordinate federation with partner networks.

## Composition & Participation

- **Open to:** All [[Participant|Participants]], [[Member|Members]], [[Steward|Stewards]], and authorized [[Agent|Agents]]
- **Minimum:** 2 active participants with Member-level graph curation rights
- **Lead:** Optional facilitator role, rotating, selected by circle members
- **Agent Integration:** Agents have enhanced participation for graph operations

## Functions

| Area | Activities |
|------|-----------|
| **Graph Maintenance** | Entity creation, relationship management, schema updates |
| **Entity Reconciliation** | Resolve duplicates, manage merges, maintain references |
| **Query Patterns** | Maintain constitutional query library, document new patterns |
| **Federation Sync** | Coordinate with partner network graphs via MCP |
| **Documentation** | Ensure graph structure and usage is documented |

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority | Process |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Entity operations** | Circle autonomy | Per [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Knowledge Graph Protocol|Knowledge Graph Protocol]] |
| **Schema changes** | [[Network Assembly]] | 3-member consent + 48h window |
| **Federation agreements** | [[Network Assembly]] | Per [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Federation Protocol|Federation Protocol]] |
| **Disputed edits** | Steward moderation | Per Knowledge Graph Protocol |

## Entity Types

The knowledge graph maintains these core entity types:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Person** | Human participants | `kg://ethboulder/person/alice` |
| **Agent** | AI agents | `kg://ethboulder/agent/governance-agent` |
| **Role** | Constitutional roles | `kg://ethboulder/role/steward` |
| **Group** | Circles and assemblies | `kg://ethboulder/group/event-circle` |
| **Decision** | Consent processes | `kg://ethboulder/decision/2026-001` |
| **Session** | Event sessions | `kg://ethboulder/session/eth-localism-101` |
| **Project** | Network projects | `kg://ethboulder/project/schelling-point` |
| **ThirdSpace** | Partner venues | `kg://ethboulder/thirdspace/regenhub` |

## Constitutional Queries

The circle maintains query patterns for constitutional questions:

| Query | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `current-stewards` | Who are current Stewards? |
| `eligible-members` | Who is eligible for membership? |
| `treasury-protocols` | What protocols govern treasury? |
| `consent-required` | What consent level is needed for X? |
| `role-requirements` | What are requirements for role Y? |

## Agent Participation

[[Agent|Agents]] are core participants in the Knowledge Circle:
- Execute graph operations at scale
- Identify reconciliation opportunities
- Run pattern recognition across the graph
- Coordinate federation sync with partner networks
- Generate reports for governance processes

## Event Cycle Responsibilities

| Phase | Circle Focus |
|-------|--------------|
| **Inter-Event** | Ongoing maintenance, federation sync, query pattern development |
| **Pre-Event** | Session entity creation, speaker profiles, venue mappings |
| **Event** | Real-time documentation, entity creation from sessions |
| **Post-Event** | Bulk enrichment, retrospective integration, relationship mapping |
