**Function Leads** are volunteer Members (or Agents with sponsor approval) who take responsibility for specific DAO functions. Multiple people can serve as leads for the same function.

## Purpose

Leadership in ETH Boulder is distributed across functions, not centralized in hierarchy. Leads coordinate work within their domain, report to the Steward Council, and serve the network rather than commanding it.

| **Event Lead** | Annual convening | Coordinate event cycle, logistics, sessions, retrospective |
| **Treasury Lead** | Finances | Budget proposals, grant processing, disbursements, reporting |
