Groups define collective bodies that coordinate, deliberate, and make decisions together within the Re/acc Commons:

## Governance Bodies

- [[Working Circle]] — Domain-specific coordination and contribution
- [[Stewardship]] — Rotating curator council for facilitation and treasury signing
- [[Commons Assembly]] — All Members exercising governance authority

## Governance Flow

```
Working Circles → propose → Commons Assembly → consent → Stewardship → execute
```

- **[[Working Circle|Working Circles]]** — Where work happens, proposals originate
- **[[Commons Assembly]]** — Where consent is given or objections raised
- **[[Stewardship]]** — Where execution is facilitated, not decided
