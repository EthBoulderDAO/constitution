Groups define collective bodies that coordinate, deliberate, and make decisions together within ETH Boulder:

## Governance Bodies

- [[Working Circle]] — Domain-specific coordination and contribution
  - [[Event Circle]] — Annual convening coordination
  - [[Knowledge Circle]] — Knowledge graph stewardship
  - [[Third Space Circle]] — Third space federation partnerships
  - [[Grants Circle]] — Local public goods funding
- [[Stewardship]] — Rotating curator council for facilitation and treasury signing
- [[Network Assembly]] — All Members exercising governance authority

## Governance Flow

```
Working Circles → propose → Network Assembly → consent → Stewardship → execute
```

- **[[Working Circle|Working Circles]]** — Where work happens, proposals originate
- **[[Network Assembly]]** — Where consent is given or objections raised
- **[[Stewardship]]** — Where execution is facilitated, not decided
