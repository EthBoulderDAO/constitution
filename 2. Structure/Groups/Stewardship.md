The rotating curator council providing facilitation, accountability facilitation, and treasury signing authority — curators who tend conditions for the commons to self-govern.

## Purpose

Stewardship serves dual functions:
**Facilitation** — Ensure consent processes are followed, maintain documentation, facilitate accountability
**Execution** — Sign treasury transactions after proper approval, merge governance PRs, execute decisions made through consent

**Critical distinction:** Stewardship facilitates and executes. It does not govern. The moment stewardship becomes governance, it has failed.

## Composition & Quorum

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Size** | 2-3 active [[Steward|Stewards]] |
| **Quorum** | 2 Stewards for coordination decisions |
| **Terms** | 1 month rotation |
| **Selection** | Full commons consent: all [[Member|Members]], 72h window |
| **Rotation** | Monthly handoff with knowledge transfer |

## Responsibilities

| Area | Activities |
|------|-----------|
| **Process Facilitation** | Ensure consent processes followed, call for clarification/escalation |
| **Documentation** | Maintain `#stewardship` channel, record decisions and rationale |
| **Constitution** | Merge governance PRs after consent documented |
| **Treasury** | Co-sign multisig transactions (agents can also sign) |
| **Accountability** | Facilitate accountability processes per protocol |
| **Emergency** | Initiate immediate action for harmful behavior (with ratification) |

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority | Process |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Facilitation matters** | Stewardship | Coordination among Stewards |
| **Governance decisions** | [[Commons Assembly]] | Stewardship facilitates, does not decide |
| **Treasury execution** | Stewardship + [[Agent\|Agents]] | Co-signers (2/4 threshold, agents can meet alone) |
| **Emergency suspension** | Any Steward | With 48h ratification requirement |
