The governing body of the network nation — all [[Member|Members]] exercising ultimate decision-making authority through sociocratic consent.

## Purpose

The Network Assembly is where the network governs itself. All foundational decisions flow through Member consent. This is not a representative body — every Member has voice and standing. Together they decide the direction of shared treasury, coordination infrastructure, and community membrane.

## Composition

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Members** | All [[Member|Members]] of the network |
| **Quorum (Standard)** | 3 explicit consents + 48h window |
| **Quorum (Foundational)** | All Members notified + 72h window |
| **Decision Mode** | Sociocratic consent — no paramount objections |

## What Is Governed

The Network Assembly governs three things:

**Shared Treasury.** A multisig wallet holding pooled resources contributed by human participants and AI agents. The treasury funds knowledge graph infrastructure, event coordination, third space partnerships, grants, and contributor compensation.

**Coordination Infrastructure.** The knowledge graph, Discord server, GitHub repositories, Schelling Point app, federation agreements, and agent infrastructure that enable participants to create mutual benefit.

**Community Membrane.** The principles, accountability processes, and membrane architecture that determine who participates and how trust is maintained.

## Decision Authority

| Scope | Reversibility | Process |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Individual Domain | Easy | Autonomy (just do it) |
| Individual Domain | Hard | Inform others (FYI post) |
| Cross-Domain | Easy | 3-member consent + 48h window |
| Cross-Domain | Hard | 3-member consent + deliberation thread |
| Foundational | Easy | 3-member consent + 48h window |
| Foundational | Hard | Full network consent (all Members, 72h) |

### Boundary Heuristic

**If it creates an expectation or dependency for other participants, it's coordination.**

- **Individual**: "I'm researching Ethereum localism patterns in other bioregions"
- **Coordination**: "The Knowledge Circle will now handle all graph entity reconciliation"
- **Foundational**: "We're changing how the treasury allocates resources"

## Consent Mechanics

**Explicit Consent Required:**
- Emoji reaction (specified below)
- Written "I consent"
- Agent-specific acknowledgment

Silence is ambiguous. We require affirmative alignment.

**Emoji Vocabulary:**
| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| :white_check_mark: | Consent |
| :thinking: | Concerns (not blocking, want discussion) |
| :hourglass_flowing_sand: | Need more time |
| :no_entry_sign: | Paramount objection |

## Paramount Objections

Not every disagreement is a paramount objection. To qualify:

1. **Articulate the Harm.** How does this proposal block our ability to function toward shared aims?
2. **Path Forward.** Either integration criteria OR counter-proposal

**Template:**
> "I object to [proposal] because [specific harm to collective function]. I consent if [integration criteria], OR I propose [alternative]."

This filters out:
- Personal preference ("I don't like this approach") → not paramount
- Aesthetic disagreement ("This isn't how I'd frame it") → not paramount
- Systemic risk ("This creates dynamics that undermine trust") → valid

**Resolution:** Objections are integrated, not overruled. The goal is a proposal everyone can align with.

## Call-Up Mechanism

Any participant can escalate a decision treated as individual domain if they see cross-domain impact. This is not punitive — it's "I see impact you might not have, let's talk."

## Event Cycle Governance

| Phase | Assembly Focus |
|-------|----------------|
| **Inter-Event** | Ongoing governance, circle coordination |
| **Pre-Event** | Event budget approval, session scheduling consent |
| **Event** | Minimal governance (emergency only) |
| **Post-Event** | Retrospective ratification, fast-track memberships |
