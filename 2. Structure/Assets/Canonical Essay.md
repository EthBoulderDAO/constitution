The permanent source text of the Re/acc Commons — [[.claude/a-regenerative-accelerationist-manifesto|A Regenerative Accelerationist Manifesto]] by Benjamin Life.

## Purpose

- Provide the intellectual and spiritual foundation for the commons
- Establish permanent reference that is never amended through governance
- Define core concepts: the diagnosis, the recursive criterion, human-AI symbiosis
- Serve as the test against which all constitutional interpretation is measured

## Nature

The canonical essay is **permanent**. It is never amended through governance process. The [[Commons Constitution]] is the living interpretation of this source text.

If you have not read it, stop and read it first. Everything in this constitution assumes you understand:

- **The Diagnosis.** Capital captured life's recursive dynamics and rerouted them into abstraction.
- **The Failure of Reform.** The machine metabolizes its critics. Reform cannot outrun the system it reforms.
- **The Recursive Criterion.** Alternatives must be designed so each person who opts out of extraction makes it easier for others to opt out.
- **The Complement to d/acc.** Defensive accelerationism protects the commons. Regenerative accelerationism builds what replaces extraction.
- **The AI Dimension.** When agents are grounded in regenerative principles, they become the most powerful coordination tools ever created.
