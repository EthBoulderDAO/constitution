The shared documentation, patterns, and protocols stewarded by the commons — knowledge that costs nothing to share and creates compounding value.

## Purpose

Knowledge is free. Sharing it costs nothing and creates compounding value. The Knowledge Commons serves:
- Pattern documentation for regenerative practices
- Protocol templates that spread what works
- Schema standards for federation interoperability
- Learning archives from experiments and outcomes

## Principles

**Design global, implement local.** Knowledge flows globally while implementation stays local. Open-source designs spread across the planet while each community adapts them to their specific context.

**The cosmolocal pattern.** Successful practices spread through adaptation rather than replication. Each local implementation feeds learnings back into the global commons.

**Machine-readable by design.** Shared metadata standards enable interoperability. AI agents can traverse, index, and connect patterns across the knowledge graph.

## Content Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Patterns** | Documented approaches that work | Membrane design, consent processes, agent integration |
| **Protocols** | Reusable process templates | Onboarding, accountability, treasury allocation |
| **Schemas** | Interoperability standards | Federation metadata, agent communication formats |
| **Learnings** | Experiment outcomes | What worked, what didn't, why |
| **Tools** | Shared infrastructure | Bots, integrations, governance tooling |

## Access Tiers

| Level | Who | Permissions |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Reader | Public | View patterns and protocols |
| Contributor | [[Participant]] and above | Add and edit documentation |
| Curator | [[Working Circle]] members | Organize, categorize, maintain quality |
| Admin | [[Member]] and above | Create structures, manage access |

## Stewardship

The [[Working Circle|Knowledge Commons Circle]] stewards this asset:
- Maintain documentation quality
- Curate and organize patterns
- Develop schema standards
- Support federation knowledge sharing

## Schema Standards

For AI-readability and federation:

```yaml
---
id: [unique-identifier]
type: [pattern|protocol|schema|learning|tool]
domain: [knowledge-domain]
federation: [public|federated|internal]
updated: [ISO-date]
---
```

## Federation

Knowledge is shared across the federated network through:
- **Schema bridges:** Agents maintaining interoperability between different knowledge commons
- **Mutual indexing:** Federated networks can discover and reference patterns
- **Shared learning:** What works in one node strengthens the whole web
