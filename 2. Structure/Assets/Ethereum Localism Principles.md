The permanent canonical source for ETH Boulder — encoding the intellectual and spiritual foundation that this constitution interprets but cannot amend.

## Purpose

The Ethereum Localism Principles document is permanent. It is never amended through governance process. This constitution is the living interpretation.

This separation serves crucial functions:
- **Stability** — Core principles remain fixed while governance adapts
- **Clarity** — Participants know what is foundational vs. what is interpretive
- **Legitimacy** — Changes to governance cannot undermine founding principles

## Location

The canonical document lives at: [[.claude/ethereum-localism-principles|Ethereum Localism Principles]]

## What the Principles Establish

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **The Vision** | Global protocols, local implementation |
| **Cosmo-Local Pattern** | Design global, implement local |
| **Network Nation Philosophy** | Sovereignty without territory |
| **Collective Intelligence** | Knowledge graphs as constitutional oracle |
| **Boulder's Position** | Scenius, bioregion, third space culture |
| **GFEL Integration** | Subsidiarity, interoperability, regeneration, plurality, sovereignty |
| **Annual Convening** | Event as constitutional moment |

## How This Constitution Relates

This constitution:
- **Interprets** the principles for operational governance
- **Operationalizes** abstract principles into concrete protocols
- **Adapts** to changing circumstances while maintaining fidelity
- **Cannot contradict** the permanent source

## Amendment Boundary

| Document | Can Be Amended? | Process |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Ethereum Localism Principles** | No | Never |

- Posting introduction as Newcomer
- Advancing through membrane architecture
- Participating in governance

The principles are not lengthy. They are dense. Read carefully.
