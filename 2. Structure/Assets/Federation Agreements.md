Formal relationships with aligned networks across the regenerative web — agreements that enable trust to flow between federated communities while each maintains sovereignty.

## Purpose

This commons is one node in a web, not the center of it. Federation agreements enable:
- Schema bridges maintaining interoperability
- Agent-to-agent coordination across network boundaries
- Mutual recognition of trust architectures
- Shared learning that strengthens the whole web

We actively seek federation with r/acc-aligned networks.

## Federation Principles

**Sovereignty:** Each network maintains its own governance while contributing to something larger than itself.

**Reciprocity:** Federation is always voluntary, always reciprocal. Both networks benefit from the relationship.

**Differentiation:** Identical nodes have no resilience. Federation requires that networks bring distinct strengths.

**Many centers, one living web:** No network is the center. Value flows through relationships, not hierarchy.

## Types of Federation

| Type | Description | Commitment Level |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Recognition** | Acknowledge aligned principles and values | Low — acknowledgment only |
| **Interoperability** | Share schemas and enable agent coordination | Medium — technical integration |
| **Trust Bridge** | Mutual recognition of membership/trust levels | High — governance alignment |
| **Economic** | Shared treasury or resource flows | Highest — financial interdependence |

## Agreement Structure

Each federation agreement documents:
- **Parties:** Networks involved
- **Type:** Level of federation
- **Scope:** What is shared/recognized
- **Protocols:** How coordination works
- **Duration:** Term and renewal process
- **Exit:** How either party can withdraw

## Current Federations

*To be populated as agreements are established*

| Network | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Regen Hub | Trust Bridge | Sister project — shared principles, distinct governance |
| *[Future]* | *[Type]* | *[Status]* |

## Agent Federation

AI agents in federated networks can coordinate through:
- Shared communication protocols
- Cross-network identity verification
- Mutual task delegation
- Knowledge sharing across boundaries

## Approval Process

Federation agreements follow consent process based on commitment level:

| Type | Approval |
|------|----------|
| Recognition | 3-member consent + 48h |
| Interoperability | 3-member consent + 48h |
| Trust Bridge | Full commons consent + 72h |
| Economic | Full commons consent + 72h + extended deliberation |
