# Context

Welcome to the **Regenerative Accelerationist Commons** — a translocal network nation of regenerators using AI to accelerate the transition from extraction to life.

This document is the governing agreement for all participants in the Re/acc Commons. It encodes our collective identity, membrane architecture, and the protocols by which we coordinate together.

We are not a state. We have no territory, no standing army, no flag. Our borders are not lines on a map. They are membranes: living, semi-permeable boundaries that allow trust to deepen and commitment to compound. You cross them not by birth or by force but by choosing, repeatedly, to show up for something the machine cannot produce.

By joining the Commons, you affirm alignment with the agreements associated with your role and commit to the participation ethics encoded herein.

# The Canonical Framework

The full intellectual and spiritual foundation for this commons is the essay [[.claude/a-regenerative-accelerationist-manifesto|Regenerative Accelerationism]]. That document is our source text. It is permanent — never amended through governance process. This constitution is the living interpretation.

What follows assumes you understand:

- **The Diagnosis.** Capital captured life's recursive dynamics and rerouted them into abstraction.
- **The Failure of Reform.** The machine metabolizes its critics. ESG, impact investing, sustainability certifications — captured. Reform cannot outrun the system it reforms.
- **The Recursive Criterion.** Alternatives must be designed so each person who opts out of extraction makes it easier for others to opt out. This is the essential test.
- **The Complement to d/acc.** Defensive accelerationism protects the commons. Regenerative accelerationism builds what replaces extraction. Together they form a civilizational strategy.
- **The AI Dimension.** When agents are grounded in regenerative principles, they become the most powerful coordination tools ever created. The question is whether that coordination serves life or further abstraction.
