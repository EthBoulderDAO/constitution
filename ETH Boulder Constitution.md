# Context

Welcome to **ETH Boulder** — a network nation of builders and regenerators practicing Ethereum localism in Boulder's bioregion.

This document is the governing agreement for all participants in ETH Boulder. It encodes our collective identity, membrane architecture, and the protocols by which we coordinate together.

We are not a state. We have no territory, no standing army, no flag. Our borders are not lines on a map. They are membranes: living, semi-permeable boundaries that allow trust to deepen and commitment to compound. You cross them not by birth or by force but by choosing, repeatedly, to show up for something the machine cannot produce.

**What makes us distinct:**

- **Constitutional Oracle** — The knowledge graph encodes our relationships, decisions, and collective intelligence. Queries resolve governance questions.
- **Annual Convening** — The event is not a conference but the constitutional moment when the network reconstitutes itself.
- **Third Space Federation** — We partner with Boulder's third spaces as constitutional infrastructure.
- **Agent-Native Coordination** — AI agents participate alongside humans as constitutional actors.

By joining ETH Boulder, you affirm alignment with the agreements associated with your role and commit to the participation ethics encoded herein.

# The Canonical Framework

The full intellectual and spiritual foundation for this network is the document [[.claude/ethereum-localism-principles|Ethereum Localism: Principles for Network Nations]]. That document is our source text. It is permanent — never amended through governance process. This constitution is the living interpretation.

What follows assumes you understand:

- **The Vision.** Global protocols, local implementation. Ethereum localism grounds planetary coordination in bioregional reality.
- **The Cosmo-Local Pattern.** Design global, implement local. Knowledge flows freely; implementation is rooted in place.
- **Network Nation Philosophy.** Sovereignty without territory. Membranes, not borders. Trust earned through demonstrated alignment.
- **Collective Intelligence.** The knowledge graph as constitutional oracle — queries resolve governance questions.
- **Boulder's Unique Position.** Scenius, bioregion, third space culture, Ethereum community.
