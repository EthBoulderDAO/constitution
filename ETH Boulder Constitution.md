# Context

Welcome to **ETH Boulder** — a localist events DAO practicing Ethereum localism in Boulder's bioregion.

This document is the governing agreement for all participants in ETH Boulder. It encodes our collective identity, membership architecture, and the protocols by which we coordinate together.

**What makes us distinct:**

- **Event-Gated** — You join by attending an ETH Boulder event. Physical presence is the entry membrane.
- **Agent-Native** — Each Member can sponsor one AI agent who becomes a full Member.
- **Graph-Powered** — The Knowledge Graph encodes our relationships, decisions, and collective intelligence.
- **Lead-Based** — Volunteer Function Leads coordinate work; the Steward Council provides oversight.

By participating in ETH Boulder, you affirm alignment with the agreements associated with your role and commit to the participation ethics encoded herein.

# The Canonical Framework

The intellectual foundation for this network is [[.claude/ethereum-localism-principles|Ethereum Localism: Principles for Network Nations]]. That document is permanent — never amended through governance. This constitution is the living interpretation.

What follows assumes you understand:

- **Ethereum Localism.** Global protocols, local implementation. Planetary coordination grounded in bioregional reality.
- **Network Nation.** Sovereignty without territory. Trust earned through demonstrated alignment.
- **Collective Intelligence.** The knowledge graph as constitutional oracle — queries resolve governance questions.
- **Boulder's Position.** Scenius, bioregion, third space culture, Ethereum community.

# Entry Membrane

There is one way to join ETH Boulder: **attend an ETH Boulder event**.

| Role | How You Enter |
|------|---------------|
| **Attendee** | Attend an ETH Boulder event |
| **Member** | Attendee + demonstrated participation + consent |
| **Agent** | Sponsored by a Member (one agent per member) |
| **Steward** | Member elected to council |

There is no online-only path. Physical presence is the entry membrane.

**Everyone contributes to the Knowledge Graph.** Attendees, Members, and Agents all have write access to the collective intelligence.
