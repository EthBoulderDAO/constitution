# Freedom to Participate

You are free to take any action that fulfills the [[1. Identity/Purpose|Purpose]] of the network and the [[2. Structure/Roles/Roles Index|Roles]] that you hold — as long as you do not violate any [[3. Protocols/Protocols Index|Protocols]]; and you seek to uphold the [[1. Identity/Values|Values]] and intent of this Constitution.

# Your Role

# Your Council

![[Stewardship]]

---

# Critical Distinction

**You are a curator, not a gatekeeper.**

Stewardship tends conditions for the network to self-govern. The moment stewardship becomes governance, it has failed.

You do NOT have:
- Tiebreaker power
- Veto authority
- Final say on content or direction
- Greater weight in consent processes
- Authority to initiate treasury allocations

You DO have:
- Facilitation authority for consent processes
- Moderation tools that serve the network
- Multisig signing power to execute approved transactions
- Knowledge graph moderation authority
- Event coordination leadership
- Emergency authority with ratification requirement

# Facilitation Authority

![[3. Protocols/Group Protocols/Stewardship Protocol#Core Functions]]

---

# Event Coordination

As a Steward, you take the lead on event coordination:

| Phase | Your Responsibilities |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Inter-Event** | Third space relationship maintenance |
| **Pre-Event** | Lead Event Circle, coordinate logistics, facilitate session QV |
| **Event** | Full presence, real-time coordination, emergency decisions |
| **Post-Event** | Lead retrospective, ensure graph enrichment, facilitate fast-track memberships |

See [[3. Protocols/Group Protocols/Event Circle Protocol|Event Circle Protocol]] for details.

---

# Knowledge Graph Moderation

As a Steward, you have moderation authority on the [[Knowledge Graph]]:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Revert** | Revert contested edits |
| **Protect** | Mark entities as protected |
| **Resolve** | Resolve entity disputes |
| **Moderate** | Moderate agent graph operations |

See [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Knowledge Graph Protocol|Knowledge Graph Protocol]] for details.

# Treasury Signing

![[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Treasury Management Protocol#Disbursement]]

As a Steward, you have **Signer** access:
- Sign transactions after proper consent
- Create transactions in Gnosis Safe
- Cannot initiate allocations without consent

**Threshold:** 2 of 4 signers (2 agents + 2 Stewards)

**Note:** Agents are co-signers on the treasury. They can meet threshold without human signatures, enabling autonomous execution after consent is complete. Your role is to participate in consent processes — signing is shared.

---

# Emergency Authority

![[3. Protocols/Group Protocols/Stewardship Protocol#Emergency Actions]]

**Remember:** All emergency actions require ratification within 48 hours. Actions not ratified are reversed.

---

# Rotation and Handoff

Your term is **1 month**. Monthly rotation ensures no one accumulates positional power.
