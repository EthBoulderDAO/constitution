To bootstrap a **Living Bioregional Network Nation State Machine** by integrating Ethereum protocols into the civic, ecological, and economic fabric of Boulder.

This involves transitioning from "tools for traders" to **infrastructure for civilizations** through:
- The RegenHub LCA (Limited Cooperative Association) as legal container
- Local coordination tools grounded in cooperative law
- Knowledge graph as constitutional oracle and collective memory
- Annual convening as constitutional renewal

We do this by:
- Stewarding the Boulder Bonfire Knowledge Graph as dynamic repository for collective learning
- Coordinating the annual ETH Boulder convening as civilizational infrastructure renewal
- Cultivating third space culture through the RegenHub LCA and federation partnerships
- Deploying agentic orchestration that coordinates real-world social friction
- Federating with aligned networks across the Ethereum localism web
