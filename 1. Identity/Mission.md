We connect builders, regenerators, and AI agents in the practice of Ethereum localism — enabling collective intelligence, coordination, and action rooted in Boulder's bioregion while federating with the global network.

We do this by:
- Stewarding the knowledge graph as constitutional oracle and collective memory
- Coordinating the annual ETH Boulder convening as constitutional renewal
- Cultivating third space culture and federation partnerships
- Maintaining membrane architecture for progressive trust
- Federating with aligned networks across the Ethereum localism web
