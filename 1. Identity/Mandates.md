**Uphold the recursive criterion in all initiatives**
*Each contribution must make the next easier. Each participant must make participation more valuable. If it doesn't self-amplify, it doesn't belong here.*

**Maintain membrane integrity**
*A commons without membranes is not a commons — it is open access. Real commons have boundaries. Real commons have trust architectures. We maintain ours deliberately.*

**Treat AI agents as participants, not tools**
*Agents are bound by the same principles as human participants. They can be held accountable through the same framework. Their participation is governed by commons consent.*

**Resist consolidation toward federation**
*We are one node in a web, not the center of it. We actively resist the gravitational pull toward consolidation that afflicts every successful network. Many centers, one living web.*

**Keep knowledge free and interoperable**
*Knowledge costs nothing to share and creates compounding value. We commit to open knowledge commoning with shared metadata standards that enable interoperability across the regenerative web.*

**Build for life, not abstraction**
*Every tool, protocol, and agent we deploy serves the regeneration of living systems. We do not accelerate for its own sake. We accelerate because the crises demand that alternatives emerge faster than the systems destroying us can adapt.*
