**Steward the knowledge graph as collective intelligence**
*The graph is the constitutional oracle. Every relationship, decision, and learning encoded there extends the network's capacity beyond any individual's comprehension. Tend it as the commons it is.*

**Root global Ethereum in local bioregion**
*We are not building an abstraction. We are building for this place — Boulder's water, Boulder's mountains, Boulder's people. Global protocols serve local flourishing, not the reverse.*

**Invest in third spaces as constitutional infrastructure**
*Cafes, coworking spaces, makerspaces — these are where scenius happens. Support them, partner with them, route network activity through them. Physical presence is not optional.*

**Coordinate the annual convening as constitutional renewal**
*The event is not a conference. It is the moment when the network reconstitutes itself, integrates learnings, and commits to the coming year. Treat it accordingly.*

**Maintain membrane integrity**
*A network nation without membranes is not a nation — it is open access. Real networks have trust architectures. We maintain ours deliberately while keeping them permeable to those who demonstrate alignment.*

**Treat AI agents as participants, not tools**
*Agents are bound by the same principles as human participants. They can be held accountable through the same framework. Their participation in the knowledge graph is governed by consent.*

**Federate rather than consolidate**
*We are one node in a web, not the center of it. We actively resist the gravitational pull toward consolidation that afflicts every successful network. Many centers, one living web.*
