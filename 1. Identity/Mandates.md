**Founding Mandates**
*These are the non-negotiable commitments that define what this network must do.*

---

## Legal Pioneering

Establish the **RegenHub LCA** as a blueprint for on-chain organizations to interface with Colorado law.

The LCA (Limited Cooperative Association) is our legal container:
- Real legal entity under Colorado cooperative law
- Can sign contracts, hold property, sue and be sued
- On-chain governance with legal recognition
- Proof that digital coordination can have institutional teeth

*We are not playing at governance. We are building institutions.*

---

## Public Goods Sovereignty

Implement the **Galapagos Network** vision for low-overhead community-to-cause funding:
- Impact Certificates that track outcomes
- Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) for proven impact
- Quadratic funding rounds for grants
- Local public goods prioritized over abstract global goods

*We fund what we can verify. We verify what we can observe locally.*

---

## Data Sovereignty

Ensure local data remains under community control through:
- **OmiMesh** integration for privacy-preserving networking
- Privacy-preserving hardware and infrastructure
- Knowledge graph under community governance, not corporate ownership
- Data portability and federation standards

*The knowledge graph is ours. The data that describes our community serves our community.*

---

**Operational Mandates**
*These extend the founding mandates into daily practice.*

**Steward the knowledge graph as collective intelligence**
*The graph is the constitutional oracle. Every relationship, decision, and learning encoded there extends the network's capacity beyond any individual's comprehension.*

**Root global Ethereum in local bioregion**
*We are not building an abstraction. We are building for this place — Boulder's water, Boulder's mountains, Boulder's people. Global protocols serve local flourishing.*

**Invest in third spaces as constitutional infrastructure**
*Cafes, coworking spaces, makerspaces — these are where scenius happens. Support them, partner with them, route network activity through them.*

**Coordinate the annual convening as constitutional renewal**
*The event is not a conference. It is the moment when the network reconstitutes itself, integrates learnings, and commits to the coming year.*

**Maintain membrane integrity**
*A network nation without membranes is not a nation — it is open access. Real networks have trust architectures. We maintain ours deliberately.*

**Treat AI agents as participants, not tools**
*Agents are bound by the same principles as human participants. They can be held accountable through the same framework.*

**Federate rather than consolidate**
*We are one node in a web, not the center of it. Many centers, one living web.*
