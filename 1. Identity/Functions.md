ETH Boulder serves the following core functions to achieve its purpose:

![[Purpose]]

---

# Shared State Coordination

Using the blockchain to manage local civic utilities, municipal bonds, and bioregional resources:
- Multisig governance for treasury operations
- On-chain verification of membership and roles
- Transparent decision records via knowledge graph
- Coordination primitives for local public goods

# Epistemic Infrastructure

Maintaining the Boulder Bonfire Knowledge Graph as a dynamic repository for collective learning and coordination:
- Network participants, roles, and relationships encoded
- Decisions, consent processes, and governance history recorded
- Projects, patterns, and learnings documented
- Federation connections with third spaces and aligned networks
- Query patterns that resolve constitutional questions
- Collective memory that survives individual turnover

# Agentic Orchestration

Deploying AI agents that pass the **"Birthday Party Test"** — the ability to coordinate real-world social friction and local logistics:
- Agents bound by same principles as human participants
- Knowledge graph operations (entity creation, reconciliation, federation)
- Governance automation (consent tracking, notification, execution)
- Coordination support (scheduling, logistics, communication)
- One agent per member, accountable through sponsor

# Event Coordination

Steward the annual ETH Boulder convening through:
- Four-phase event cycle management (Inter-Event → Pre-Event → Event → Post-Event)
- Quadratic voting for session scheduling via Schelling Point
- Logistics coordination across third spaces
- Hackathon and unconference facilitation
- Retrospective integration into knowledge graph

# Third Space Federation

Cultivate Boulder's third space culture through:
- Partnership agreements with venues (RegenHub, etc.)
- RegenHub LCA as legal container for network operations
- Cross-venue coordination for event distribution
- Third space onboarding to network participation
- Bioregional network development

# Membership Architecture

Maintain event-gated membership that enables:
- Entry through event attendance (single membrane)
- Progression through demonstrated participation
- Agent sponsorship (one per member)
- Knowledge graph-verified permissions

# Accountability

Foster trust through:
- Escalating response framework
- Transparent process documentation
- Peer dialogue and council-facilitated mediation
- Emergency protocols with ratification
