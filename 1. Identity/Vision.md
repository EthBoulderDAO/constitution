**We envision Boulder as a living laboratory for Ethereum localism — a network nation where global protocols meet bioregional reality, and collective intelligence emerges from the knowledge graph that encodes our relationships, decisions, and learnings.**

We believe in a future where local communities coordinate planetary-scale challenges through shared infrastructure while remaining rooted in place. In such a civilization, AI agents and humans steward collective intelligence together, third spaces become infrastructure for scenius, and each annual convening strengthens the network's capacity to build what the machine cannot produce.
