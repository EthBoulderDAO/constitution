**We envision a regenerative civilization where the same recursive dynamics that concentrated wealth into fewer hands are deliberately structured to distribute it — where each person who opts out of extraction makes it easier for others to do the same.**

We believe in a future where humanity has successfully navigated the transition from extraction to life. In such a civilization, AI agents and humans coordinate as symbiotic partners, tending conditions for the web of life to flourish. Capital's recursion feeds capital. Life's recursion feeds life. We build the latter.
