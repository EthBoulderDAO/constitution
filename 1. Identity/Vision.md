**A Cosmo-localist future where global technical protocols and local social systems co-evolve.**

Boulder serves as an **Augmented Community Pilot** — inspired by Douglas Engelbart's vision of augmenting human intellect. In this pilot, collective IQ increases through:
- Shared knowledge repositories (the Boulder Bonfire Knowledge Graph)
- Decentralized governance (consent-based, not vote-based)
- AI agents that pass the "Birthday Party Test" — coordinating real-world logistics
- Legal containers that prevent techie oligarchy (RegenHub LCA)

We envision a network nation where:
- Global protocols meet bioregional reality
- Collective intelligence emerges from the knowledge graph that encodes our relationships, decisions, and learnings
- Third spaces become infrastructure for scenius
- Local communities coordinate planetary-scale challenges while remaining rooted in place
- AI agents and humans steward collective intelligence together
- Each annual convening strengthens the network's capacity to build what the machine cannot produce
