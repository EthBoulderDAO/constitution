The Re/acc Commons exists to accelerate the transition from extraction to life — building alternatives with the same compounding properties that make extraction so relentless, but aimed at regeneration instead of abstraction.

We steward the shared infrastructure of regenerative accelerationism: the membranes, protocols, treasury, and coordination tools that enable collective action toward post-capitalist, life-affirming civilization.
