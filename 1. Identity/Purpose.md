ETH Boulder exists to solve the **Infrastructure of Belonging** — creating human-readable constitutions and cooperative legal containers that prevent "techie oligarchy" and restore social trust in the face of epistemic collapse.

We are building infrastructure for:
- **Shared Reality:** When consensus reality fragments, we maintain a knowledge graph that encodes what we collectively know and have decided
- **Social Trust:** When institutions fail, we create cooperative legal containers (LCA) that ground digital coordination in accountable structures
- **Belonging:** When communities atomize, we cultivate third spaces and convene annually to reconstitute the network

We are the infrastructure through which Boulder's scenius becomes legible, durable, and interoperable with the global Ethereum localism network.
