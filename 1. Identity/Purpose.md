ETH Boulder exists to steward the collective intelligence of Boulder's Ethereum community — coordinating the annual convening, cultivating the knowledge graph as constitutional oracle, and catalyzing third space culture across the bioregion.

We are the infrastructure through which Boulder's scenius becomes legible, durable, and interoperable with the global Ethereum localism network.
