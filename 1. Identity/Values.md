**Core Principles**
*These are not aspirational. They are operational commitments. Every participant upholds them. Violation triggers accountability.*

## Scenius Cultivation

We nurture the conditions for collective genius to emerge. Boulder's scenius is not individual brilliance but the intelligence that arises from the right people in the right place, cross-pollinating ideas through proximity and serendipity. We protect and extend this ecology.

## Bioregional Solidarity

Our work serves this place — the Front Range, its watersheds, its communities, its future. Global coordination capacity is valuable only insofar as it strengthens local resilience and regeneration. We are rooted, not abstracted.

## Quadratic Fairness

Voice should scale with genuine commitment, not wealth or position. Quadratic mechanisms — for voting, for funding, for session scheduling — prevent plutocratic capture while honoring differential engagement. Many small voices outweigh few large ones.

## Third Space Culture

The best ideas emerge between — between work and home, between disciplines, between strangers who become collaborators. We invest in the physical and digital third spaces where serendipity lives.

## Federation Over Consolidation

We are one node in a web, not the center of it. We seek federation with bioregional networks, Ethereum localism communities, cooperative federations, and other aligned commons. Many centers, one web.

## Knowledge as Commons

Knowledge is free. Sharing it costs nothing and creates compounding value. We commit to open knowledge commoning with the graph as our shared memory. Design global, implement local.

## Leaderful, Not Leaderless

Authority flows by context and competence, not position. Multiple centers of leadership coexist. Different people — and agents — lead in different domains according to demonstrated capacity. We reject both domination culture and performative diminishment.

## Consent, Not Consensus

We coordinate through alignment beyond agreement. Consent means no one with relevant stake has a paramount objection. It does not require enthusiasm. This enables functional pluralism — multiple strategic approaches coexisting, sharing learnings, resilient through diversity.
