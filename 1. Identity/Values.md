**Core Principles**
*These are not aspirational. They are operational commitments. Every participant upholds them. Violation triggers accountability.*

## Institutional Localism

Grounding digital sovereignty in physical, legal cooperative structures. We do not build abstractions — we build the RegenHub LCA, a Colorado cooperative that can sign contracts, hold property, and interface with existing institutions. Digital coordination without legal grounding is vapor.

## Collective Intelligence

Prioritizing AI for sensemaking and group problem-solving over simple automation. Agents don't replace humans — they augment collective IQ. The knowledge graph is infrastructure for collective intelligence, not just data storage. We are an Augmented Community Pilot.

## Regenerative d/acc

Using defensive acceleration to protect and grow the commons. This means:
- Agroforestry, biodiversity, and ecological public goods
- Infrastructure that resists extraction
- Technology that strengthens rather than atomizes community
- Acceleration in service of life, not capital

## Controlled Chaos

Maintaining a high-signal, low-friction "scenius" that allows for organic community shaping. We are not bureaucrats. The best ideas emerge from serendipitous collision in third spaces. We create conditions for emergence while maintaining enough structure for coordination.

**Secondary Values**
*Extensions of core principles into practice.*

## Quadratic Fairness

Voice should scale with genuine commitment, not wealth or position. Quadratic mechanisms — for voting, for funding, for session scheduling — prevent plutocratic capture while honoring differential engagement. Many small voices outweigh few large ones.

## Federation Over Consolidation

We are one node in a web, not the center of it. We seek federation with bioregional networks, Ethereum localism communities, cooperative federations, and other aligned commons. Many centers, one web.

## Knowledge as Commons

Knowledge is free. Sharing it costs nothing and creates compounding value. We commit to open knowledge commoning with the graph as our shared memory. Design global, implement local.

## Leaderful, Not Leaderless

Authority flows by context and competence, not position. Multiple centers of leadership coexist. Different people — and agents — lead in different domains according to demonstrated capacity.

## Consent, Not Consensus

We coordinate through alignment beyond agreement. Consent means no one with relevant stake has a paramount objection. It does not require enthusiasm. This enables functional pluralism.

**Participation Ethics**
*Behavioral and cultural patterns of participants.*

- Good Faith Collaboration
- Honesty and Transparency
- Feedback and Mutual Accountability
- Efficacy over Ego
- Inclusion and Deep Listening
