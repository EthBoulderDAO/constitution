**Core Principles**
*These are not aspirational. They are operational commitments. Every participant upholds them. Violation triggers accountability.*

## Life-Affirming Acceleration

Every tool, protocol, and agent we deploy serves the regeneration of living systems. We do not accelerate for its own sake. We accelerate because the crises demand that alternatives emerge faster than the systems destroying us can adapt.

## The Recursive Criterion

Our work must compound. Each contribution makes the next easier. Each participant makes participation more valuable. Each project strengthens conditions for others. If it doesn't self-amplify, it doesn't belong here. This distinguishes r/acc from lifestyle environmentalism.

## Federation Over Consolidation

We are one node in a web, not the center of it. We seek federation with bioregional networks, Ethereum localism communities, cooperative federations, indigenous sovereignty movements, and other r/acc-aligned commons. Many centers, one web.

## Knowledge as Commons

Knowledge is free. Sharing it costs nothing and creates compounding value. We commit to open knowledge commoning with shared metadata standards that enable interoperability. Design global, implement local.

## Leaderful, Not Leaderless

Authority flows by context and competence, not position. Multiple centers of leadership coexist. Different people — and agents — lead in different domains according to demonstrated capacity. We reject both domination culture and performative diminishment.

## Consent, Not Consensus

We coordinate through alignment beyond agreement. Consent means no one with relevant stake has a paramount objection. It does not require enthusiasm. This enables functional pluralism — multiple strategic approaches coexisting, sharing learnings, resilient through diversity.

## Post-Tragic Audacity

We are collapse-aware. The crisis is real. We build anyway. Not from naive optimism but from the recognition that surrender and complicity are the only unacceptable positions. We plant seeds in soil we know may burn because the alternative is guaranteed desolation.
