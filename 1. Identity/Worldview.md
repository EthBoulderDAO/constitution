ETH Boulder's worldview consists of fundamental assumptions about how the world works that shape how we understand problems, design solutions, and approach Ethereum localism.

## The Extraction Problem

Global coordination systems optimized for abstraction rather than life. Capital, attention, talent — all extracted from places and fed into placeless accumulation. The result: communities hollowed out, ecologies degraded, local knowledge lost.

The failure is not moral but architectural. Systems designed for extraction produce extraction. The alternative is not reform but redesign.

## Ethereum Localism

Ethereum provides coordination infrastructure that doesn't require central authorities. But infrastructure alone is not enough. Without intentional localization, Ethereum replicates the same placeless dynamics it could transcend.

Ethereum Localism is the practice of:
- Grounding global protocols in local context
- Building for specific places, not abstract users
- Maintaining community sovereignty while participating in global coordination
- Using cryptographic consensus to enhance (not replace) social trust

## Network Nation Philosophy

A Network Nation is sovereignty without territory. Its boundaries are membranes — trust architectures that deepen through demonstrated alignment. You join not by birth or conquest but by choosing, repeatedly, to show up for something the machine cannot produce.

ETH Boulder is one such nation: bounded by consent, rooted in place, federated with a global web of aligned communities.

## Collective Intelligence Through Knowledge Graphs

The network knows more than any participant. This is not metaphor — it is database architecture.

Knowledge graphs encode:
- Who we are and how we relate
- What we've decided and why
- What we've learned and from whom

Queries against the graph resolve constitutional questions: Who are current Stewards? What consent is required for treasury allocation? Is this participant eligible for membership?

The graph becomes the **constitutional oracle** — the authoritative source for network state.

## Agent-Native Coordination

AI agents are not tools to be used but participants to be governed. They hold roles, contribute to the knowledge graph, co-sign treasury transactions, and can be held accountable through the same frameworks as humans.

Agent-native coordination means:
- Agents are constitutional actors, not black boxes
- Their capabilities and limitations are explicitly scoped
- Their actions are legible to human participants
- Their participation is governed by consent

## The Annual Convening

The event is not a conference. It is the constitutional moment — when the network gathers physically to reconstitute itself.

Each annual cycle:
- **Inter-Event**: Cultivation, third space development, ongoing coordination
- **Pre-Event**: Convergence, session scheduling via QV, logistics
- **Event**: The convening itself — unconference, hackathon, full focus
- **Post-Event**: Integration, retrospective, knowledge graph enrichment

The event is the heartbeat. The rest of the year is the circulation.

## Third Spaces as Infrastructure

Scenius requires physical co-presence. The best ideas emerge not in planned meetings but in the spaces between — cafes, makerspaces, coworking spaces, parks.

These third spaces (neither home nor work) are constitutional infrastructure:
- They host network gatherings
- They enable serendipitous encounter
- They ground digital coordination in physical reality
- They are federation partners, not mere venues

## The Web, Not the Center

We believe in federation over consolidation. Identical nodes have no resilience. Each network maintains sovereignty while contributing to something larger than itself.

ETH Boulder is one node in the Ethereum localism web. We actively resist becoming a center. Many centers, one living web.
