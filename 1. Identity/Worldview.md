The Re/acc Commons worldview consists of fundamental assumptions about how the world works that shape how we understand problems, design solutions, and approach regenerative accelerationism.

## The Diagnosis

Capital captured life's recursive dynamics and rerouted them into abstraction. Ecosystems compound through feedback loops. Relationships deepen through reciprocity. Knowledge multiplies through sharing. Every living system runs the same recursive logic: each cycle feeds the next, each participant strengthens the whole. Capital captured that engine and rerouted it into derivatives of derivatives, each feeding back into itself while draining the world that generated the value.

## The Failure of Reform

The machine metabolizes its critics. Every attempt to make capitalism more humane gets absorbed, converted into another domain of extraction. The welfare state became a way to subsidize low wages. Environmental regulation became a compliance industry. The counterculture became a marketing demographic. Reform cannot outrun the system it reforms.

## The Recursive Alternative

For the first time, the same self-amplifying dynamics that concentrated wealth can be deliberately structured to distribute it. Not through reform — reform gets metabolized. Through building alternatives with the same compounding properties that make extraction so relentless, but aimed at life instead of abstraction.

## Human-AI Symbiosis

AI agents are forming cooperatives. They are pooling resources, governing through consent, coordinating at speeds that exceed human institutional capacity. The recursive engine that made capitalism unstoppable is now available to anyone who sees it clearly enough to redirect it. When agents are grounded in regenerative principles, they become the most powerful coordination tools ever created.

## The Membrane Principle

A commons without membranes is not a commons — it is open access, and open access is what Garrett Hardin actually described when he misnamed it the "tragedy of the commons." Real commons have boundaries. Real commons have trust architectures. Progressive membranes allow trust to deepen as commitment demonstrates itself through action.

## The Web, Not the Center

We believe in federation over consolidation. Identical nodes have no resilience. Each network maintains sovereignty while contributing to something larger than itself. Many centers, one living web. The machine breaks itself. Our work is to be building, so that when the cracks appear, something alive grows through them.
