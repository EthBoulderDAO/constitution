This protocol governs the formation, operation, and coordination of the [[Knowledge Circle]] — stewards of the constitutional oracle and the network's collective intelligence.

## Instantiation

**Trigger Type:** Continuous (circle operates year-round)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Knowledge graph requires maintenance
- Entity reconciliation needed
- Schema changes proposed
- Federation sync coordination

## Authority & Oversight

| Role | Authority | Accountability |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Circle Members | Entity operations, curation | [[Network Assembly]] |
| Member Curators | Reconciliation, contested edits | Circle members |
| Agent Operators | Graph operations within scope | Circle members |
| [[Network Assembly]] | Schema changes, federation agreements | Constitution |

## Operations

### Core Functions

| Function | Description | Lead |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Entity Maintenance** | Create, update, archive entities | Circle members |
| **Reconciliation** | Merge duplicates, resolve conflicts | Member curators |
| **Query Development** | Maintain constitutional query library | Circle + agents |
| **Schema Evolution** | Propose and implement schema changes | Circle → Assembly |
| **Federation Sync** | Coordinate with partner graphs | Agent operators |

### Participation Requirements

- Minimum 2 active participants with Member-level curation rights
- Agent participation for graph operations
- Regular sync meetings (async or live)

### Curation Rotation

- Curation duties rotate among Members
- No single curator dominates reconciliation decisions
- Agent flags, human decides

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority | Process |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Entity creation | Circle (per [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Knowledge Graph Protocol|Graph Protocol]]) | Direct |
| Entity reconciliation | Member curators | Per Graph Protocol |
| Contested edits | Steward moderation | Escalation path |
| Schema changes | [[Network Assembly]] | Standard consent |
| Query pattern additions | Circle | Circle consent |
| Federation agreements | [[Network Assembly]] | Per [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Federation Protocol|Federation Protocol]] |

### Escalation Path

When entity disputes arise:
1. Circle discussion (attempt resolution)
2. If unresolved, Steward moderation
3. If fundamental disagreement, Network Assembly

## Event Cycle Integration

| Phase | Circle Focus |
|-------|--------------|
| **Inter-Event** | Ongoing maintenance, federation sync, query development |
| **Pre-Event** | Session entity creation, speaker profiles, venue mappings |
| **Event** | Real-time documentation, entity creation from sessions |
| **Post-Event** | Bulk enrichment, retrospective integration, relationship mapping |

### Event Documentation Protocol

During and after the event:
| Step | Action | Actor | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Assign session documenters | Event Circle | Pre-Event |
| 2 | Real-time session notes | Documenters | During Event |
| 3 | Create session entities | Agent | During Event |
| 4 | Enrich with relationships | Circle | Post-Event |
| 5 | Link to people, projects, themes | Circle | Post-Event |

## Agent Coordination

### Agent Roles

| Agent Role | Responsibilities |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Validation Agent** | Schema validation, integrity checks |
| **Reconciliation Agent** | Flag duplicates, suggest merges |
| **Federation Agent** | Sync with partner graphs |
| **Query Agent** | Execute constitutional queries |

### Agent Oversight

Circle maintains oversight of agent operations:
- Weekly review of agent-initiated changes
- Audit trail review for anomalies
- Scope adjustment recommendations to Assembly

## Quality Assurance

### Integrity Checks

| Check | Frequency | Actor |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Schema validation | Continuous | Agent |
| Orphan detection | Daily | Agent |
| Relationship integrity | Daily | Agent |
| Duplicate detection | Continuous | Agent |
| Manual audit | Weekly | Circle |

### Quality Metrics

Track and report:
- Entity creation rate
- Reconciliation backlog
- Query success rate
- Federation sync status
- Integrity violations
