This protocol governs the formation, operation, and coordination of [[Working Circle|Working Circles]] — domain-specific groups where the visible life of the commons unfolds.

## Instantiation

**Trigger Type:** Action-based

**Trigger Conditions:**
- 2+ participants propose new circle with clear domain
OR
- Existing circle convenes for coordination

## Authority & Oversight

| Role | Authority | Accountability |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Circle Members | Internal coordination, domain decisions | [[Commons Assembly]] |
| Circle Facilitator | Meeting facilitation, task coordination | Circle members |
| [[Commons Assembly]] | Approve formation, cross-domain proposals | Constitution |

## Formation Process

| Step | Action | Actor | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Identify domain need | 2+ participants | Discovery |
| 2 | Draft circle proposal | Proposers | As needed |
| 3 | Post in `#proposals` | Proposers | Initiates consent |
| 4 | Consent window | [[Commons Assembly]] | 48 hours |
| 5 | Create circle channel | [[Steward]] | After consent |
| 6 | Onboard initial members | Circle | Immediate |

### Circle Proposal Contents

- **Domain:** What area this circle covers
- **Purpose:** What the circle aims to accomplish
- **Initial Members:** Who is proposing (minimum 2)
- **Boundaries:** What is in scope, what is not
- **Relationship:** How this relates to other circles

## Operations

### Participation

- Open to all [[Participant|Participants]], [[Member|Members]], [[Steward|Stewards]]
- [[Agent|Agents]] participate within authorized scope
- No maximum membership
- Minimum 2 active participants to maintain circle

### Facilitation

- Optional facilitator role (rotating encouraged)
- Selected by circle members through internal consent
- Responsibilities: schedule meetings, track tasks, maintain documentation
- No additional authority over decisions

### Meetings

- Frequency determined by circle
- Asynchronous coordination encouraged
- Decisions through circle consent
- Notes posted in circle channel

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Authority | Process |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Internal coordination** | Circle | Consent within circle |
| **Domain-specific work** | Circle | Autonomy with FYI |
| **Cross-domain impact** | [[Commons Assembly]] | 3-member consent + 48h |
| **Resource requests** | [[Commons Assembly]] | Per [[3. Protocols/Asset Protocols/Treasury Management Protocol\|Treasury Protocol]] |

### Boundary Heuristic

**If it creates an expectation or dependency for other circles or participants, it's cross-domain.**

- Internal: "Our circle will document regenerative agriculture patterns"
- Cross-domain: "The Knowledge Commons circle will now handle all documentation for the network"

## Agent Participation

[[Agent|Agents]] participate in circles within their authorized scope:
- Can propose and consent on domain-specific matters
- Counted in circle quorum (if circles adopt quorum)
- Cannot participate in circles outside authorized domains
- Pattern recognition contributions valued

## Sunset Process

Circles sunset when:
- Fewer than 2 active participants for 30+ days
- Circle members consent to merge or close
- Domain absorbed into another circle through commons consent

**Process:**
1. Stewardship notes inactivity or receives closure proposal
2. Post notification in `#proposals`
3. 48h window for objections or revival interest
4. If no revival: archive channel, document learnings
5. Transfer any ongoing responsibilities to appropriate circle

## Conflict Between Circles

If circles have overlapping claims or conflicts:
1. Circles attempt direct coordination
2. If unresolved, post in `#proposals` for community input
3. [[Commons Assembly]] mediates through standard consent
