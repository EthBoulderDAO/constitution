## Overview

Function Leads are volunteer Members (or Agents with sponsor approval) who coordinate specific DAO functions. This is not a hierarchy — leads serve the network by coordinating work, not by commanding others.

**Key principles:**
- Volunteer-based (no elections required)
- Multiple leads per function allowed
- Training/onboarding required before serving
- Report to Steward Council monthly
- Can step down at any time
