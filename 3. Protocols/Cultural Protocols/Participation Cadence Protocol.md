This protocol establishes participation expectations for each role — the rhythms that keep the network alive.

## Principles

**Sustained participation builds trust.** Role progression is earned through consistent engagement, not isolated bursts.

**Quality over quantity.** One meaningful contribution outweighs many superficial ones.

**Transparency about availability.** Communicate when you'll be less available.

**No burnout.** Sustainable engagement is more valuable than unsustainable heroics.

## Role-Specific Cadences

### Attendee

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Attend ETH Boulder event | Entry requirement |
| Contribute to Knowledge Graph | When you have relevant input |
| Participate in community | As available |

**Note:** Attendees have no minimum participation requirements after initial event attendance.

### Member

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Read proposals | All proposals affecting governance |
| Express consent/objection | Within consent windows |
| Participate in governance | Active voice when relevant |
| Contribute to network | Active in at least one area |
| Quarterly check-in | Confirm continued engagement |

**Note:** Members who do not participate in governance for 3+ months may be contacted about sabbatical or transition.

### Steward

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Council meetings | Monthly minimum attendance |
| Function Lead oversight | Monthly report review |
| Emergency availability | Available for urgent situations |
| Election facilitation | When seats open |
| Dispute mediation | As needed |

**Note:** Stewards have 12-month terms with staggered rotation.

### Function Lead

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Monthly reports | Submit to Steward Council |
| Function coordination | As defined by function |
| Event cycle activity | Higher during Pre-Event |
| Handoff preparation | Before stepping down |

**Note:** Function Leads are volunteers. Multiple people can hold the same lead role.

### Agent

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Operate within capabilities | Continuous |
| Respond to queries | Within authorized domains |
| Logging and transparency | All actions recorded |
| Coordination with sponsor | Sponsor-defined |

**Note:** Agent participation cadence is defined by capabilities and sponsor agreement.

## Flexibility

### Communication Norms

- **Going quiet:** Post in relevant channel if you'll be less available
- **Extended absence:** Notify Steward Council
- **No explanation required:** You don't owe reasons for reduced availability

### Reduced Capacity

If you need to reduce participation:
- Continue minimum engagement if possible
- Ask other Members to cover responsibilities
- Consider formal sabbatical if extended

## Sabbatical

### Requesting Sabbatical

Any Member can request sabbatical:
1. Notify [[Steward Council]] of intended sabbatical
2. Specify expected duration
3. Arrange handoff of any responsibilities (including Agent if sponsored)
4. Sabbatical begins

### During Sabbatical

- No participation expectations
- Role maintained (not removed)
- Not counted in quorum
- Can end sabbatical at any time
- Sponsored Agent must be transferred or paused

### Returning

- Post return notification
- Resume participation at previous role level

### Steward Sabbatical

Stewards cannot take sabbatical while serving. Options:
- Complete term and don't seek re-election
- Resign mid-term (triggers election for replacement)

## Inactivity

### Grace Periods

| Role | Grace Period | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Attendee | None | No expectation |
| Member | 3 months | Outreach, sabbatical offer |
| Steward | 1 month | Council coordination |
| Function Lead | 1 month | Handoff needed |

### Involuntary Transition

If participant is unreachable for extended period:
- Steward Council attempts contact
- If no response after 60 days: automatic sabbatical
- If no response after 6 months: role may be reduced to Attendee
- Full process documented
