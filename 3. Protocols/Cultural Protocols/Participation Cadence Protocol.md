## Principles

**Sustained participation builds trust.** Membrane crossing is earned through consistent engagement, not isolated bursts.

**Quality over quantity.** One meaningful contribution outweighs many superficial ones.

**Transparency about availability.** Communicate when you'll be less available.

**No burnout.** Sustainable engagement is more valuable than unsustainable heroics.

## Role-Specific Cadences

### Newcomer

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Read manifesto + constitution | Before introduction |
| Post introduction | Any time |
| Observe commons | Self-paced |

**Note:** Newcomers are not expected to participate actively. The threshold is about arrival, not contribution.

### Participant

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Engage in public channels | Weekly (minimum) |
| Participate in Working Circle | Active in at least one |
| Contribute to discussions | When you have relevant input |
| Read proposals | Stay aware of governance |

**Minimum for verification:** 2 weeks sustained participation with meaningful contributions

### Member

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Read proposals | All proposals affecting governance |
| Express consent/objection | Within consent windows |
| Participate in governance | Active voice when relevant |
| Contribute to commons work | Active in at least one domain |
| Quarterly check-in | Confirm continued engagement |

**Note:** Members who do not participate in governance for 3+ months may be contacted about sabbatical or transition.

### Steward

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Monitor consent processes | Daily (async is fine) |
| Coordinate with Stewardship | Weekly |
| Facilitate when needed | As processes require |
| Treasury oversight | Review all proposals |
| Accountability facilitation | As triggered |
| Documentation | Maintain #stewardship |
| Handoff preparation | Before rotation |

**Note:** Stewardship is the most active role. Monthly rotation prevents burnout.

### Agent

| Activity | Expectation |
|----------|-------------|
| Operate within scope | Continuous |
| Respond to queries | Within authorized domains |
| Pattern recognition | As defined in scope |
| Logging and transparency | All actions recorded |
| Coordination with operator | Operator-defined |

**Note:** Agent participation cadence is defined by authorized scope and operator agreement.

## Flexibility

### Communication Norms

- **Going quiet:** Post in relevant channel if you'll be less available
- **Extended absence:** Notify Working Circle and/or Stewardship
- **No explanation required:** You don't owe reasons for reduced availability

### Reduced Capacity

If you need to reduce participation:
- Continue minimum engagement if possible
- Ask circle members to cover responsibilities
- Consider formal sabbatical if extended

## Sabbatical

### Requesting Sabbatical

Any participant can request sabbatical:
1. Notify [[Stewardship]] of intended sabbatical
2. Specify expected duration
3. Arrange handoff of any responsibilities
4. Sabbatical begins

### During Sabbatical

- No participation expectations
- Role maintained (not removed)
- Not counted in quorum
- Can end sabbatical at any time

### Returning

- Post return notification
- Abbreviated re-onboarding if extended absence
- Resume participation at previous role level

### Steward Sabbatical

[[Steward|Stewards]] cannot take sabbatical while serving. Options:
- Complete term and don't seek re-selection
- Resign mid-term (triggers selection for replacement)
- Request early rotation if circumstances require

## Inactivity

### Grace Periods

| Role | Grace Period | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Newcomer | None | No expectation |
| Participant | 2 months | Outreach from Onboarding Circle |
| Member | 3 months | Outreach, sabbatical offer |
| Steward | 2 weeks | Coordination with Stewardship |

### Involuntary Transition

If participant is unreachable for extended period:
- Stewardship attempts contact
- If no response after 60 days: automatic sabbatical
- If no response after 6 months: role may be reduced
- Full process documented
