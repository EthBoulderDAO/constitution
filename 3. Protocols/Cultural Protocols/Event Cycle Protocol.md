This protocol defines the four-phase annual rhythm that structures ETH Boulder's coordination — from cultivation through convening to integration.

## The Annual Cycle

The annual convening is not a conference — it is the **constitutional moment** when the network reconstitutes itself. The rest of the year prepares for and integrates that moment.
