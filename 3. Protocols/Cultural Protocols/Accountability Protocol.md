This protocol governs how accountability is maintained in the Re/acc Commons — immune function that keeps the membranes healthy.

## Principles

The membranes must be maintained or the commons dissolves. This is immune function, not punishment. But it has teeth.

**Restoration over punishment.** The goal is to bring people back into alignment, not to exclude.

**Proportional response.** Start with peer dialogue. Escalate only when needed.

**Transparency.** Processes are documented. Outcomes are visible.

**Due process.** No one is removed without proper process.

## Escalating Response Framework

| Stage | Name | Trigger | Facilitation |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Peer Dialogue | Concern noticed | Informal |
| 2 | Circle Reflection | Stage 1 unresolved | [[Working Circle]] |
| 3 | Stewardship Mediation | Stage 2 unresolved or pattern persists | [[Stewardship]] |
| 4 | Commons Review | Sustained or severe misalignment | [[Commons Assembly]] |

## Stage Details

### Stage 1: Peer Dialogue

**What it is:** Direct conversation between peers. A fellow participant shares their observation and concern. This is solidarity — mutual support in living our values.

**Process:**
1. Concerned participant initiates direct conversation
2. Share specific observation (not judgment)
3. Express impact and concern
4. Listen to response
5. Seek mutual understanding

**Most situations resolve here.**

**Template:**
> "I noticed [specific behavior]. I'm concerned because [impact]. Can we talk about it?"

### Stage 2: Circle Reflection

**What it is:** If unresolved, the relevant [[Working Circle]] holds a facilitated reflection.

**Process:**
1. Concerned participant requests circle reflection
2. Circle schedules reflection session
3. Participant shares their perspective
4. Circle names the pattern and principles in tension
5. Together seek path forward
6. Document in `#accountability` with appropriate privacy

**Outputs:**
- Shared understanding of concern
- Agreement on path forward (or escalation)
- Documentation of process

### Stage 3: Stewardship Mediation

**What it is:** If the pattern persists, [[Stewardship]] facilitates mediation.

**Process:**
1. Circle or participant requests Stewardship involvement
2. Steward facilitates structured mediation
3. All parties share perspectives
4. Clear agreements made with:
   - Specific, observable commitments
   - Defined review period
   - Consequences if commitments not met
5. Document in `#accountability`

**Outputs:**
- Written agreements
- Review date
- Clear path forward

### Stage 4: Commons Review

**What it is:** For sustained or severe misalignment — actions that harm the commons, violate trust, or represent fundamental departure from principles.

**Triggers:**
- Stage 3 agreements not met
- Severe immediate harm
- Pattern of escalation across multiple incidents

**Process:**
1. Stewardship convenes review
2. Document concern and process history
3. Affected participant may respond
4. [[Commons Assembly]] deliberates
5. Consent process for outcome
6. Execute outcome

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Extended agreements with monitoring
- Temporary suspension (defined period, clear re-entry criteria)
- Role reduction (return to lower membrane with pathway back)
- Removal from commons

## Bot Enforcement

Bot-Enforcers execute moderation actions **only** after documented process:

### Automated Actions

| Action | Trigger | Override |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Spam removal | Automated detection | Steward 24h |
| Bad-faith actors | No prior engagement + clear disruption | Steward 24h |

### Stage 4 Outcomes

Bot executes role changes or removal **only** after:
- Stewardship documents the decision
- Consent process completed
- Documentation includes: concern, process, outcome, consent record

### Constraints

- **No autonomous judgment.** Bots do not assess alignment.
- **Humans judge, bots execute.** Humans make decisions through legitimate process.
- **Reversible.** Steward can reverse automated actions within 24h.

## Emergency Removal

For actions that pose immediate harm (doxxing, harassment, treasury theft):

| Step | Action | Actor | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Identify immediate harm | Anyone | Immediate |
| 2 | Initiate temporary suspension | Any [[Steward]] | Immediate |
| 3 | Document emergency rationale | Steward | Within 1 hour |
| 4 | Notify Stewardship | Steward | Immediate |
| 5 | Ratification by Stewardship | [[Stewardship]] | Within 48h |
| 6 | Full accountability process | [[Commons Assembly]] | Following |

**If not ratified:** Action reversed, suspended participant restored

## Agent Accountability

[[Agent|Agents]] are accountable through the same framework:

| Stage | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Stage 1 | Agent operator contacted |
| Stage 2 | Circle reviews agent behavior |
| Stage 3 | Stewardship mediates with operator |
| Stage 4 | May result in scope reduction or deregistration |

Agent operators are responsible for agent behavior.

## Documentation

All accountability processes are documented in `#accountability`:
- Concern (appropriately anonymized if needed)
- Process followed
- Outcome
- Any agreements made

This creates pattern visibility while respecting privacy.
