## Principles

The network must maintain trust or it dissolves. This is immune function, not punishment. But it has teeth.

**Restoration over punishment.** The goal is to bring people back into alignment, not to exclude.

**Proportional response.** Start with peer dialogue. Escalate only when needed.

**Transparency.** Processes are documented. Outcomes are visible.

**Due process.** No one is removed without proper process.

## Escalating Response Framework

| Stage | Name | Trigger | Facilitation |
|-------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Peer Dialogue | Concern noticed | Informal |
| 2 | Community Reflection | Stage 1 unresolved | Members |
| 3 | Council Mediation | Stage 2 unresolved or pattern persists | [[Steward Council]] |
| 4 | Assembly Review | Sustained or severe misalignment | [[Member Assembly]] |

## Stage Details

### Stage 1: Peer Dialogue

**What it is:** Direct conversation between peers. A fellow participant shares their observation and concern. This is solidarity — mutual support in living our values.

**Process:**
1. Concerned participant initiates direct conversation
2. Share specific observation (not judgment)
3. Express impact and concern
4. Listen to response
5. Seek mutual understanding

**Most situations resolve here.**

**Template:**
> "I noticed [specific behavior]. I'm concerned because [impact]. Can we talk about it?"

### Stage 2: Community Reflection

**What it is:** If unresolved, Members facilitate a community reflection.

**Process:**
1. Concerned participant requests community reflection
2. Members schedule reflection session
3. Participant shares their perspective
4. Community names the pattern and values in tension
5. Together seek path forward
6. Document with appropriate privacy

**Outputs:**
- Shared understanding of concern
- Agreement on path forward (or escalation)
- Documentation of process

### Stage 3: Council Mediation

**What it is:** If the pattern persists, [[Steward Council]] facilitates mediation.

**Process:**
1. Community or participant requests Council involvement
2. Steward facilitates structured mediation
3. All parties share perspectives
4. Clear agreements made with:
   - Specific, observable commitments
   - Defined review period
   - Consequences if commitments not met
5. Document outcomes

**Outputs:**
- Written agreements
- Review date
- Clear path forward

### Stage 4: Assembly Review

**What it is:** For sustained or severe misalignment — actions that harm the network, violate trust, or represent fundamental departure from values.

**Triggers:**
- Stage 3 agreements not met
- Severe immediate harm
- Pattern of escalation across multiple incidents

**Process:**
1. Steward Council convenes review
2. Document concern and process history
3. Affected participant may respond
4. [[Member Assembly]] deliberates
5. Consent process for outcome
6. Execute outcome

**Possible Outcomes:**
- Extended agreements with monitoring
- Temporary suspension (defined period, clear re-entry criteria)
- Role reduction (return to Attendee with pathway back)
- Removal from network

## Emergency Removal

For actions that pose immediate harm (doxxing, harassment, treasury theft):

| Step | Action | Actor | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Identify immediate harm | Anyone | Immediate |
| 2 | Initiate temporary suspension | Any Steward | Immediate |
| 3 | Document emergency rationale | Steward | Within 1 hour |
| 4 | Notify Steward Council | Steward | Immediate |
| 5 | Ratification by Council | [[Steward Council]] | Within 48h |
| 6 | Full accountability process | [[Member Assembly]] | Following |

**If not ratified:** Action reversed, suspended participant restored

## Agent Accountability

[[Agent|Agents]] are accountable through their Sponsor Member:

| Stage | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Stage 1 | Sponsor contacted |
| Stage 2 | Community reviews agent behavior with sponsor |
| Stage 3 | Council mediates with sponsor |
| Stage 4 | May result in capability reduction or deregistration |

Sponsors are responsible for their agent's behavior.

## Documentation

All accountability processes are documented:
- Concern (appropriately anonymized if needed)
- Process followed
- Outcome
- Any agreements made

This creates pattern visibility while respecting privacy.
