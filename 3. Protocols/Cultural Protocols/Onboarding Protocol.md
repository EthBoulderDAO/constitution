## Entry Membrane

ETH Boulder has a **single entry membrane**: attending an ETH Boulder event. There is no online-only path to participation.

**Why event-based entry?**
- Physical presence builds genuine community
- Shared experience creates alignment
- Third space culture requires co-presence
- Localism means being local

## Authority & Oversight

| Role | Authority | Accountability |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Event Lead | Verify attendance, facilitate entry | [[Steward Council]] |
| [[Agent]] | Assist with verification, provide guidance | Sponsor Member |
| Existing Members | Informal mentorship | Community norms |

## Process

### Becoming an Attendee
