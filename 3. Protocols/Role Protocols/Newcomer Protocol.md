## Instantiation

**Trigger Type:** Action-based

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Individual arrives at Discord server
- Individual indicates intent to join the commons

## Authority & Oversight

| Role | Authority | Accountability |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| [[Agent]] | Verify introduction completeness | [[Stewardship]] |
| Arriving Individual | Complete requirements | Community norms |
| [[Steward]] | Override verification if needed | [[Commons Assembly]] |

## Process

| Step | Action | Actor | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Read [[.claude/a-regenerative-accelerationist-manifesto\|Manifesto]] | Arriving individual | Self-paced |
| 2 | Read [[Re-acc Commons Constitution\|Constitution]] | Arriving individual | Self-paced |
| 3 | Post introduction in `#threshold` | Arriving individual | Self-paced |
| 4 | Verify introduction completeness | [[Agent]] | Automated |
| 5 | Assign @Newcomer role | Bot | Immediate |

### Step 1-2: Read Source Documents

Before posting introduction, read:
- The [[.claude/a-regenerative-accelerationist-manifesto|Regenerative Accelerationist Manifesto]] (canonical essay)
- This [[Re-acc Commons Constitution|Constitution]]

Understanding these documents is prerequisite for meaningful participation.

### Step 3: Post Introduction

Post in `#threshold` addressing:
- **Who you are** — Name/handle, brief background
- **Where you are** — Location, bioregion, or context
- **What draws you** — Why re/acc resonates, what brought you here
- **What you bring** — Skills, interests, what you want to contribute

### Step 4-5: Verification

[[Agent]] assesses introduction completeness:
- All four elements addressed
- No copy-paste or low-effort responses
- Genuine engagement with the material

If complete: Bot assigns @Newcomer role automatically
If incomplete: Agent responds with guidance on what's missing

## Verification

Agents verify based on:
- Presence of all required elements
- Evidence of having read source documents
- Genuine (not performative) engagement

**What agents do NOT assess:**
- Alignment with principles (demonstrated later through action)
- Quality of ideas (diversity valued)
- Prior experience or credentials

## Completion & Outputs

**Protocol completes when:**
- Introduction posted addressing all elements
- Agent verification passes
- @Newcomer role assigned

**Outputs:**
- Individual has @Newcomer role
- Individual can read public channels
- Individual can proceed toward [[Participant Protocol|Participant]] status

## Membrane Significance

This is Membrane Zero: The Threshold. You have entered the nation. You are seen. You are not yet trusted with coordination infrastructure or treasury. Trust builds in layers. Each crossing earns the next.
