## Instantiation

**Trigger Type:** Condition-based (continuous monitoring)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- [[Newcomer]] demonstrates sustained aligned participation (minimum 2 weeks)
- [[Agent]] flags contribution patterns meeting threshold
- Automatic verification passes

## Authority & Oversight

| Role | Authority | Accountability |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| [[Agent]] | Pattern recognition, flag readiness | [[Stewardship]] |
| Bot | Role assignment on verification | System logs |
| [[Steward]] | Override verification if needed | [[Commons Assembly]] |

## Criteria

![[Participant#Criteria]]

## Process

| Step | Action | Actor | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Participate actively | [[Newcomer]] | Minimum 2 weeks |
| 2 | Contribute to working circle | Newcomer | During observation period |
| 3 | Demonstrate alignment in practice | Newcomer | Continuous |
| 4 | Agent flags readiness | [[Agent]] | When patterns meet threshold |
| 5 | Verify and assign role | Bot | Automatic |
| 6 | Mint Participation NFT | Smart Contract | On role assignment |

### Step 1-3: Demonstration Period

The Newcomer participates actively for minimum 2 weeks:
- Engages in discussions across channels
- Contributes to at least one [[Working Circle]]
- Upholds principles in how they engage, handle disagreement, show up for others

This is not a checklist. It is a pattern.

### Step 4-5: Agent Verification

Agent continuously observes and flags when patterns meet threshold. This is not surveillance — it is pattern recognition. Verification is automatic once threshold met.

### Step 6: On-Chain Record

Participation NFT minted to record membrane crossing:
- Verifiable credential of Participant status
- Unlocks @Participant Discord role via bot
- Provides on-chain proof of commons participation

## Pattern Recognition

Agents assess (not volume, not performance):
- Does this person contribute to others' work or only promote their own?
- Do they engage with disagreement constructively?
- Do they uphold the principles when it costs them something?
- Do they show up consistently, not just when it's exciting?

**Flags for attention (not automatic disqualification):**
- Long periods of inactivity followed by bursts
- Engagement only in controversial topics
- Consistent failure to acknowledge others' contributions
- Pattern of self-promotion without community contribution

## Completion & Outputs

**Protocol completes when:**
- Minimum 2 weeks participation
- Agent verification passes
- Role and NFT assigned

**Outputs:**
- Individual has @Participant role
- Participation NFT in wallet
- Full read/write access to public commons
- Can raise objections in governance (not counted in quorum)
- Eligible for [[Member Protocol|Member]] nomination
